# ECE-128-Lab-11
The objective of this lab was to design an adder using Vivado IP. Throughout the course of the lab, we explored the IP library and learned how to effectively implement IP to build a multi-level design. The adder was designed to intake two 8 bit inputs and produce a 8 bit output. Furthermore, in order to simulate our adder module, we created a custom testbench for the top module. Then, through Implementation, we analyzed the area utilization to see how our design utilizes the FPGA board components. Finally, we programmed the design to the FPGA board and tested our design for success. 1) Copy files to Vivado project and input into Design Sources 2) Copy testbench to Simulation Sources 3) Run sysnthesis and implementation 4) Generate bitstream 5) Program the FPGA board 6) Run the program
